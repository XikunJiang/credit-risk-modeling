### Credit Risk Modeling Pipeline
#Overview

This repository contains a Python pipeline for credit risk prediction using machine learning. The project is based on the Home Credit Default Risk dataset and focuses on assessing the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and result visualization.

# Features

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes numerical data, and encodes categorical and ordinal attributes.

Feature Engineering: Selects relevant features for credit risk modeling.

Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses GridSearchCV to optimize the best model.

Visualization: Generates confusion matrices and prediction distribution plots.

Model Persistence: Saves trained models and predictions for further analysis.

# Dataset

Source: Kaggle - Home Credit Default Risk

Target Variable: TARGET (1 = Default, 0 = No Default)

# Key Features:

Numerical: AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, DAYS_BIRTH

Categorical: NAME_INCOME_TYPE, OCCUPATION_TYPE

Ordinal: NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE, REGION_RATING_CLIENT_W_CITY

# Installation

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7) and install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn joblib

# Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-risk-modeling.git
cd credit-risk-modeling

Run the script:

python credit_risk_pipeline.py

Outputs:

Classification Reports (*_classification_report.txt)

Confusion Matrices (*_confusion_matrix.png)

Prediction Results (*_predictions.csv)

Trained Models (*_model.pkl)

# Results

Accuracy & Performance Metrics: The model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction Visualization: Histogram plots show the distribution of predicted defaults vs. actual outcomes.

# Future Improvements

Implement feature selection for better model performance.

Explore additional models (e.g., Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting).

Integrate real-world credit risk data.
